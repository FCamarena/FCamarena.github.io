## Fernando Camarena
### PhD Candidate in Computer Science | AI Researcher

Welcome to my academic portfolio! I'm a Computer Science researcher at Tecnológico de Monterrey, specializing in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches in action recognition using self-supervised and few-shot learning techniques.

### 🔬 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of:
- **Self-supervised Learning**: Developing methods for learning from unlabeled data
- **Few-shot Learning**: Creating models that can learn from limited examples
- **Action Recognition**: Understanding and analyzing human actions in videos
- **Computer Vision**: Advancing the field of visual understanding
- **Deep Learning**: Exploring novel neural network architectures

### 🎓 Academic Journey

Currently pursuing my PhD at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I also completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science with highest honors. As an adjunct professor, I guide students through AI projects and share my expertise in computer science.
