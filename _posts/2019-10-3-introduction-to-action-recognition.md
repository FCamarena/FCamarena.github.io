title: Introduction to Action Recognition

When I was a child I dreamed about a world where machines adquire "super-powers". 
Today, I'm working hard to make that dream a reality, but how?

Maybe, you have heard about Artificial Intelligence (AI), but what about Computer Vision?. That sound a very creepy thing but its only aims is to give a computer eyes. 

Computer Vision has a lot of application. Nevertheless, in this post, I'll only focus on Action Recognition, which in simple words is to determine what a subject is doing in a given video. Yes, like Big brother (See image 2.0)

This is not a trivial task (Fortunaly?) but possible through  Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. Let's begin with a brief explanation about what an action is. 

### Human Activity Recognition
Human Activity Recognition (HAR)[REF] can be categorized into 3 levels: Gestures, Actions and Interactions. A gesture is an atomic movement, an action is a sequence of gestures with an associated message, and interactions are actions in which two or more agents are involved. A more compresive explanation is showed in figure 3.0
