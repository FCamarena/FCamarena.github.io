    "content": "Fernando CamarenaPhD Candidate in Computer Science | AI ResearcherWelcome to my academic portfolio! I’m a Computer Science researcher at Tecnológico de Monterrey, specializing in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches in action recognition using self-supervised and few-shot learning techniques.🔬 Research InterestsMy research lies at the intersection of:  Self-supervised Learning: Developing methods for learning from unlabeled data  Few-shot Learning: Creating models that can learn from limited examples  Action Recognition: Understanding and analyzing human actions in videos  Computer Vision: Advancing the field of visual understanding  Deep Learning: Exploring novel neural network architectures🎓 Academic JourneyCurrently pursuing my PhD at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I also completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science with highest honors. As an adjunct professor, I guide students through AI projects and share my expertise in computer science.📚 Website Sections  About: Detailed background and research interests  Posts: Technical insights and research updates  Categories: Content organized by topics  Archives: Chronological listing of all content🤝 Let’s ConnectI’m always interested in collaborating on research projects and discussing ideas in AI and Computer Vision:  📧 Email  🎓 Google Scholar  🔬 ORCID  💼 LinkedIn  💻 GitHubFeel free to explore my research work and reach out for collaborations or discussions!"
